Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.
No. We have no way of determining how much size was allocated for the strings
based on the arguments we are given. The pointers that are passed into the
function simply tell us where the strings begin, they don't tell us how
much memory was allocated for the string.
